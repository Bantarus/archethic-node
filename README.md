# Uniris

Welcome to the Uniris Node source repository ! This software enables you to build the first transaction chain and next generation of blockchain focused on scalability and human oriented.

Uniris features:
- Fast transaction processing (> 1M tps)
- Lower energy consomption than other blockchain
- Designed with a high level of security (ARCH consensus supporting 90% of maliciousness)
- Adapative cryptographic algorithms (quantum resistant)
- Decentralized Identity and Self Sovereign Identity
- Smart contract platform powered by a build-in interpreter
- Strong scalability with geo secured sharding

## Development

Our codebase aims to reach the guidelines of Elixir projects.
We are focusing on the best quality.

The source code can be brough to change to respect the best quality of reading and regarding best practices.

Current implemented features:
- Adapative cryptography: different elliptic curves and software implementation
- TransactionChain: basic struct and transaction generation
- Smart Contract: interpreter coded with Elixir DSL through Metaprogramming and AST
- Node election: heurisitic validation and storage node selection


## Contribution

Thank you for considering to help out with the source code. 
We welcome contributions from anyone and are grateful for even the smallest of improvement.
